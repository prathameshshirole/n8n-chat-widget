## Installation

### 1. Add the Script to Your Website

Include the following script in your HTML file to initialise the widget:

```html
<!-- Widget Configuration -->
<script>
    window.ChatWidgetConfig = {
        webhook: {
            url: '<your n8n webhook URL>',
            route: 'general' // Optional: Specify the route for n8n webhook processing
        },
        branding: {
            logo: '<your company logo URL>',
            name: 'Your Company Name', // Your company name
            welcomeText: 'Hi ðŸ‘‹, how can we help?', // Welcome message
            responseTimeText: 'We typically respond right away' // Response time message
        },
        style: {
            primaryColor: '#854fff', // Primary color
            secondaryColor: '#6b3fd4', // Secondary color
            position: 'right', // Position of the widget (left or right)
            backgroundColor: '#ffffff', // Background color of the chat widget
            fontColor: '#000000' // Text colour for messages and interface
        }
    };
</script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/prathameshshirole/n8n-chat-widget@latest/n8n-chat-widget.js"></script>
<!-- Widget Script -->

```

## Replace Placeholder Values

Update the following placeholders in the ChatWidgetConfig object:

1. `<your n8n webhook URL>:` Your n8n webhook endpoint URL.
2. `<your company logo URL>:` Direct link to your logo (e.g., hosted on AWS S3 or GitHub).
3. Customise branding and styling options as needed

## How It Works
- **User Interaction:** When a user interacts with the chat widget, their message is sent to the specified n8n webhook URL.
- **Webhook Processing:** The n8n workflow processes the incoming message and performs actions such as sending emails, triggering notifications, or integrating with third-party services.
- **Response Handling:** Responses from the n8n workflow can be configured to display back in the chat widget (requires additional setup).

## Example Use Cases
1. Customer Support

2. Lead Generation
Collect leads by capturing user queries and forwarding them to your CRM or marketing automation tools.

3. Feedback Collection
Use the widget to gather feedback from users and store it in a database for analysis.
